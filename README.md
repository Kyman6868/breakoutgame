# breakoutgame

This is a classic game where the goal is to break all the bricks and keep the ball alive. This was by far the hardest program ive written. It was my first time really combining differnt languages to make them work together. After getting stuck for hours (literally for over 18 hours straight at one point) and starting over and over again I was finally able to figure out how to congiure my package.json file to allow for multiple scripts to be written and ran simultaneously. In doing so, it isnpire me to use my new knowledge to build another game.
